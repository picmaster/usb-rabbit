USB-Rabbit is a small C library for high-speed data transfers over USB, using
specialized hardware (FTDI USB devices, FPGA handshake).

FTDI modules that support synchronous FIFO:
- UM232H

Tasks, WIP:
- Add support for FTDI synchronous FIFO

TODO:
- Add support for FTDI FT1248 mode
-Add support for Cypress FX2
